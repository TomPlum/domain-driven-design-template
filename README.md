# Domain-Driven Design Template
A Domain-Driven Design template project with Gradle &amp; Spring Boot for IntelliJ IDEA. Inspired by 'Domain-Driven Design: Tackling Complexity in the Heart of Software, by Eric J. Evans'.

## Layered Architecture 
The concept of layers in software design is a metaphor that is widely accepted in the industry. They allow different
parts of the system to operate in isolation, conforming to the separation of concerns, while only depending on
themselves and the layers beneath them.

> In an object-orientated program, UI, database, and other support code often gets written directly into the business
objects. Additional business logic is embedded in the behaviour of UI widgets and database scripts. This happens
because it is the easiest way to make things work, in the short run.

So although its easy to 'hack' your new features into the codebase to speed up the implementation delivery, 
forethought into the design of the application, the domain, and its elements will ultimately eliminate future code
debt and make the software easier to maintain, extend and understand. 

### Presentation
This is essentially the UI (User Interface).

### Application

### Domain

### Infrastructure
